##  Task Criterias

- Task 1: Open a file and put data into an array
- Task 2: Check to see if a user input is english letters only or not
- Task 3: Open a file of scores for each letter. Use this data to then be able to take in a character input from the user and return a score of that letter.
- Task 4: Similar to Task 3 but open a file that contains every english word. Check to see if the word is in this dictionary and then add up the scores of all the characters.
- Task 5: Create a function that takes in a word and an array of characters. See if the characters in the array can be used to form the word. Return true or false.
- Task 6: Create a function that takes in a word, dictionary and array of characters. Proceed to check whether the word fits into the dictionary and the array of characters can be used to form the word. Return true or false.
